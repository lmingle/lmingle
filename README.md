In my spare time I explore:

- Kubernetes homelabs
- DIY CNC machines
- Electronics
- Application architecture
- Programming

## Projects I really like
- [UnitsNET](https://github.com/angularsen/UnitsNet) - When performing calculations this library helps you keep your units correct. As a bonus, I used this in an application to allow users to enter quantities in any unit and it automatically converted it to the current culture without any additional effort on my part.
- [k0s](https://github.com/k0sproject/k0s) - A small single binary to create and build a Kubernetes cluster.
